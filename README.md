Objective -
A program which will convert Infix expression to Postfix expression and Evaluate a Postfix expression using array as a stack.

Logic - 

1. For Case 1 - 
2. Input is taken as a string.
3. If number or alphabet is encountered, then it is put in  Stack B and if operator is encountered then priority order is checked.
4. If according to the priority order, the operator encountered is of lower order then it is pushed-in in Stack A.
5. If according to the priority order, the operator encountered is of higher order then it is pop-out from Stack A annnd pushed-in in Stack B.
6. The Resultant Stack B is Shown
7. For Case 2 -
8. Input is taken as a string.
9. If number or alphabet is encountered, then it is put in  Stack and if operator is encountered then priority order is checked.
10. If according to the priority order, the operator encountered is of lower order then the higher order is pop out and computation is done.
11. If according to the priority order, the operator encountered is of higher order then it is pushed-in in the Stack.
12. The computed value is shown.
